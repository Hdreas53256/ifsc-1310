  <h4>Thoughts on Accesibilty</h4> 
  <p>When first starting the assigned video I thought I already had a good idea on accessibility. I thought that accessibility was just the methods of options that developers made to make it easier for people that would be using whatever they made. After watching the video I found that I'm still somewhat right but there is so much else to it, it not just makes it easier for people but it can also be essential to the functionality of the program all together. I also found that accessibility options can become really difficult to do sometimes which is crazy that one of the most overlooked and simplest looking things could require a lot of effort to do. Looking at it from a video game standpoint it really makes me value the devs more that work on the accessibility options since this does take a lot of effort.</p>

  <h4>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h4>
  <p>Going into this assignment I would have unknowingly said that I have no idea what progressive Enhancement is I couldnâ€™t have been more wrong. I've unknowingly been learning /practicing Progressive Enhancement. Now what exactly is Progressive Enhancement, well from what I understand it is the practice of focusing on the content of the website. This helps ensure that more browsers are able to run your website with ease while also allowing delivering a good experience to others that will access the site too.</p>
  <p>Now there is another method besides Progressive Enhancement, this method is called The Graceful Degradation Perspective (will be referred to as GDP). The GDP seems to be a more brutal method of website design where it focuses more on what is deemed as advanced/capable browsers. This seems to leave the older browsers behind and makes the user experience less than desirable or even not a possibility at all in worse cases.</p>
  <p>I will say that looking at it as a greater whole I see the appeal of Progressive Enhancement since it seems to focus on the component that is the most important to a website which is content. Content is one of the most important things to us as a website developer and to the user that is trying to gain information from the website. Progressive Enhancement definitely seems like the way to go when creating a website and sounds like it will help more people in the long run.</p>
