  <h3>Thoughts on Accesibilty</h3> 
  When first starting the assigned video I thought I already had a good idea on accessibility. I thought that accessibility was just the methods of options that developers made to make it easier for people that would be using whatever they made. After watching the video I found that I'm still somewhat right but there is so much else to it, it not just makes it easier for people but it can also be essential to the functionality of the program all together. I also found that accessibility options can become really difficult to do sometimes which is crazy that one of the most overlooked and simplest looking things could require a lot of effort to do. Looking at it from a video game standpoint it really makes me value the devs more that work on the accessibility options since this does take a lot of effort.
